0x11. C - printf Team Project
Overview
This team project aims to develop a custom implementation of the printf function in C programming language. The purpose of this project is to accurately produce output according to a given format. The project adheres to a professional standard and aims to deliver high-quality results.

Key Features
Conversion Specifiers: The project handles various conversion specifiers, providing the ability to format and display different data types.

Custom Conversion Specifiers: In addition to standard conversion specifiers, the project includes custom conversion specifiers to extend the functionality of printf.

Buffer Optimization: The project optimizes performance by utilizing a local buffer of 1024 characters, minimizing the number of calls to the write function.

Flag Characters: The project handles flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers, enhancing the formatting options.

Length Modifiers: The project supports length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers, allowing precise control over the data types being printed.

Field Width: The project handles field width for non-custom conversion specifiers, enabling proper alignment and formatting of output.

Precision: The project provides support for precision control for non-custom conversion specifiers, ensuring accurate display of floating-point numbers and other relevant data types.

Integration: All the above features are designed to work seamlessly together, allowing for comprehensive and versatile formatting options.

Installation
