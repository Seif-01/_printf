printf Team Project
This project is a collaborative effort to implement a custom version of the printf function in the C programming language.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a function that generates output based on a provided format. The function should support various conversion specifiers, allowing for the printing of different data types and formats. The primary objective is to mimic the functionality of the standard printf function.

Conversion Specifiers
The implemented printf function should handle the following conversion specifiers:

%c: Print a single character.
%s: Print a string.
%%: Print a literal '%' character.
In addition to the mandatory conversion specifiers, the project also involves the implementation of custom conversion specifiers.

Custom Conversion Specifiers
The project requires handling the following custom conversion specifiers:

%r: Print a reversed string.
%R: Print a rot13-encoded string.
%p: Print a memory address.
Buffer Optimization
To optimize performance, a local buffer of 1024 characters should be used to minimize the number of write system calls.

Additional Features
The project includes the implementation of various features to enhance the functionality of the printf function:

Handling flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Handling length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers ('l' and 'h').
Supporting conversion specifiers for integers: 'd', 'i', 'u', 'o', 'x', 'X'.
Handling field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Handling precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Handling the '0' flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Handling the '-' flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
Collaboration
The team will work together to ensure all features are implemented correctly and meet the project requirements. Collaboration and effective communication are key to the success of this project.

Notes
The team should keep in mind that all the above options should work well together, allowing for the seamless integration of various formatting and conversion options.

Let's work together and create a powerful and efficient printf function implementation
